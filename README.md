A Raspberry Pi + node.js powered handheld pokemon tracker

I'll be using a Raspberry Pi Zero paired with an [Adafruit 2.8" Touchscreen](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1601) and a [small, cheap GPS unit](http://www.aliexpress.com/item/Free-Shipping-1PC-Ublox-NEO6MV2-GPS-Module-Aircraft-Flight-Controller-For-Arduino-New/1765520677.html?ws_ab_test=searchweb201556_0,searchweb201602_2_10057_10056_10055_10037_301_10059_10032_10058_10017_10060_10061_10062_413,searchweb201603_4&btsid=fdda1f04-91af-423c-8e0a-e54817bc1071) + a phone battery pack to make a handheld device. I'll be using node.js, electron, and the reverse-engineered [pokemon-go-node-api](https://github.com/Armax/Pokemon-GO-node-api) to create the interface.

# But why?
- Because I could
- Biking! I wanted to make it easier to play on a bike.
- So I could set it up in a room of people, and alert the whole room, similar to my [Pokemon Go Slackbot](https://github.com/hlfshell/pokemon-go-slackbot) but for AFK people

#Status
This is a work in progress for right now, so expect this to be a "when I can work on it" project.
